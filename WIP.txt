Working next on:
- Calendar: allowing user to add their own event (add calendar category: general)
- Analytics page
- Chatbot page
- Flashcards page
- Quiz generator page
- AI-Usage Token tracking
- Settings page

Issues to troubleshoot:
- AI deliverables of the assignments have HTML code in them and sometimes state that they're AI generated
- Chatbot is still too robotic and is programmed for only specific prompts, at least initially.
- Chatbot is also not very educated on the students' info. (ie "what's my grade in this class?" its response would be to recommend a study guide)
- Remove "This looks like instructions, not a student deliverable. I will not auto-complete this. Signals were inconclusive for a student deliverable." AND "No model names are shownâ€”just student-friendly guidance." from Assignment Page

Features to be added:
- Calendar section/page with assignment/event names under each day
- Gamification feature (badges for submitting assignments on time, maintaining certain grades/GPA, etc)
- Token price for almost every AI action/button. During testing, we need to track the average token usage per user per day so we can set freemium/PRO limits.
- Notes upload OR in-app note-taking/ (remnote??) (PRO feature: draw mode???); scanned and referenced by AI
- Ads for freemium members
- Study collaboration/username lookup and private chat
- Customizable theme (dark mode? PRO feature: custom backgrounds?)
- (PRO feature) Live transcription and notetaking of class/audio
- (PRO feature) YouTube transcript-pull for students to paste video links and AI generate notes from it
- (PRO feature) AI Study Tools page (AI Essay Writer/Helper, Flashcards (Quizlet integration), Quiz/Practice Questions Maker)
- (PRO feature) Analytics page to track progress in each class (Topics/Modules proficiency tracking)
- Generate calendar integration links with Apple and Google Calendar, directly linked to DueD8
- AI Slides Maker?
