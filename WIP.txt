Issues to troubleshoot:
    -AI deliverables of the assignments have html code in them and sometimes state that they're AI generated
    -Chatbot is still too robotic and is programmed for only specific prompts, at least initially.
    -Chatbot is also not very educated on the students' info. (ie "what's my grade in this class?" its response would be to recommend a study guide)
    - remove "This looks like instructions, not a student deliverable. I will not auto-complete this.
Signals were inconclusive for a student deliverable." AND "No model names are shownâ€”just student-friendly guidance." from Assignment Page

    -Gamification feature (badges for submitting assignments on time, maintaining certain grades/GPA, etc)
    -Notes upload OR in-app note-taking/ (remnote??) (draw mode???); scanned and referenced by AI
