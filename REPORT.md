# DueD8 Implementation Report

## Summary of changes
- Added secure Canvas token management via `electron/canvasService.ts` with keytar + AES fallback, structured IPC handlers, and a shared `IpcResult` contract.
- Exposed a typed preload bridge for Canvas IPC, introduced renderer logger/toast utilities, and expanded the Zustand store to track connection state, profile data, and transient toasts.
- Rebuilt the Connect and Dashboard screens to validate tokens, render Canvas profile/courses/assignments/calendar data, and support disconnect flows using the new IPC client (`src/lib/canvasClient.ts`).
- Improved developer guidance in `README.md` and created shared logging/type helpers across the codebase.

## Files touched
- Added: `electron/canvasService.ts`, `electron/logger.ts`, `src/lib/logger.ts`, `src/lib/canvasClient.ts`, `src/shared/ipc.ts`, `src/types/index.d.ts`, `REPORT.md`.
- Updated: `electron/ipc.ts`, `electron/preload.ts`, `electron/main.ts` (indirect logging usage), `src/renderer/state/store.ts`, `src/renderer/pages/ConnectCanvas.tsx`, `src/renderer/pages/Dashboard.tsx`, `src/renderer/main.tsx`, `README.md`.
- Removed: `src/preload/index.d.ts` (replaced by `src/types/index.d.ts`).

## Test evidence
- `window.dued8.canvas.testToken()` → _not executed in container; Canvas credentials are required. Validate manually by running the Electron app, connecting with a valid token, and confirming `{ ok: true, data: { profile: … } }` is returned (redact personal data before sharing)._ 
- Screenshots: _not captured in this environment. Generate via the running Electron app for both the Connect and Dashboard screens once Canvas data is available._

## Remaining risks and next steps
- **Keytar installation**: npm access was unavailable in the container, so the keytar module could not be installed. The code dynamically falls back to encrypted file storage, but the dependency should be installed locally to take advantage of native keychain storage.
- **Canvas data volume**: The assignment fetch currently does not handle pagination. If more than the default page size of upcoming assignments exist, extend `getAssignments` to paginate.
- **Rate limits / host failover**: IPC already logs host status codes. If repeated failures occur, consider exponential backoff or caching to avoid hitting Canvas rate limits.
- **Future enhancements**: add caching per endpoint, skeleton states, and a course filter for assignments as hinted in the stretch goals.
